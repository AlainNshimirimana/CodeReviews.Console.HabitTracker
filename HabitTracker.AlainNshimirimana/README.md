# Habit Tracker #

This console application will allow the user to log their workouts.
This is a console-based CRUD application. Developed using C# and SQL.

## Requirements ##

- [x] This is an application where you'll log occurences of a habit.
- [x] This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day).
- [x] Users need to be able to input the date of the occurence of habit.
- [x] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database.
- [x] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn't present.
- [x] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [x] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [x] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [x] You can only interact with the database using ADO.NET. You can't use mappers such as Entity Framework or Dapper.
- [x] Follow the DRY Principle, and avoid code repetition.
- [x] Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.


## Challenges I faced ##

* This was my first time coding in a almost a year. So I had a lot of refreshing to do in order to under the code and continue where I left off.
* I still struggle with DateTime stuff. Such as formatting.
